## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Hotspot Scale Control**: Teachers can now configure default hotspot diameter via activity settings form (0.1 to 3.0 scale)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for 3D viewer - Tab to focus, Arrow keys to navigate hotspots, Enter/Space to activate, Escape to close tooltips
- **Screen Reader Support**: Tooltips now include `role="tooltip"`, `aria-live="polite"`, and `aria-label` attributes for proper screen reader announcements
- **Touch/Long-Press Support**: Mobile users can long-press (0.5s) on hotspots to view tooltips with haptic feedback on supported devices
- **Tooltip Animations**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions with scale animation (200ms duration) for improved user experience
- **Visual Focus Indicator**: Canvas shows outline highlight when focused for keyboard users

### Changed
- Canvas is now focusable with `tabindex="0"` and `role="application"` for better accessibility
- Tooltip icons marked as `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen reader redundancy

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Three.js Upgrade**: Migrated from Three.js r128.0 (2021) to r160.0 (2024), gaining 3+ years of security patches, performance improvements, and WebXR enhancements
- **ES Module Architecture**: Replaced legacy global `THREE` object with modern ES module imports (`import * as THREE from 'three'`)
- **Self-Hosted Dependencies**: Eliminated CDN dependencies for Three.js - now bundled locally via Rollup for improved reliability and performance
- **Build System**: Added Rollup bundler to convert ES modules to AMD format for Moodle compatibility
- **Deprecated APIs**: Updated `THREE.sRGBEncoding` to `THREE.SRGBColorSpace` (r152+ standard)
- **Hotspot Visibility**: Increased default hotspot scale from `1.0` to `1.5` and geometry from `0.08` to `0.12` radius for better visibility

### Added
- **Hover Tooltips**: Interactive tooltips showing hotspot type icon, title, and description on hover (see `docs/TOOLTIP_SYSTEM.md`)
- **Smart Positioning**: Tooltips follow mouse cursor with automatic edge detection to stay on-screen
- **Type-Specific Icons**: Font Awesome icons for each hotspot type (info, quiz, audio, video, teleport)
- Rollup configuration (`rollup.config.js`) for ES module bundling
- New build dependencies: `three`, `@rollup/plugin-node-resolve`, `@rollup/plugin-commonjs`, `rollup`, `grunt-rollup`
- Documentation: `docs/TOOLTIP_SYSTEM.md` with tooltip system details

### Removed
- CDN script loading for Three.js core, OrbitControls, TransformControls, and GLTFLoader from `view.php`

### Migration Notes
- See `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for detailed migration guide and testing checklist
- No database changes required - fully backward compatible
- Run `npm install && npx grunt amd` to rebuild after updating

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **WebXR Controllers**: Full hand tracking and laser pointer support for VR headsets to interact manually with hotspots.
- **Text Chat**: Added real-time Peer-to-Peer text chat using WebRTC Data Channels in the collaborative mode, alongside the existing voice chat.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Added `report.php` offering visual bar charts and tabular tracking metrics (hotspot clicks, VR starts, etc.) for teachers with `mod/gear:manage` capabilities.
- Added Analytics button dynamically to the viewer header interface if the user has management permissions.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Visual Authoring Gizmo**: Integrated `THREE.TransformControls` so teachers can move and position hotspots seamlessly dragging them along X/Y/Z axes in the 3D space, instead of manually clicking points.
- **WebRTC Spatial Voice Chat**: Integrated PeerJS for serverless P2P voice communication. Users' microphones are automatically spatialized as `THREE.PositionalAudio` attached to their collaborative avatars.
- **Auto Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Added a native browser-based Speech Synthesis engine. Users can click the speaker icon on any Info hotspot to have its content narrated aloud automatically.
- **Gamification & Branching Scenarios**: Hotspots can now be locked until a specific quiz is completed correctly. This enables "Escape Room" style learning where solving puzzles unlocks new areas or information.
- **Teleport Waypoints**: A new hotspot type that doesn't show a popup but instead seamlessly flies the camera to a new location in the 3D scene, ideal for guided navigation.
- **Popup Animation**: Unlocked hotspots now appear with a smooth scaling "pop" animation when their condition is met.

### Changed
- **Performance Optimization**: Significant framerate improvements for mobile devices and WebXR by dynamically capping device pixel ratios and hinting `high-performance` power preference to the GPU.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Video hotspot type**: authors can now attach a video URL to any hotspot, supporting both direct video files (`.mp4`, `.webm`, `.ogg`) and embedded iframes (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
- Video playback rendered inside the hotspot popup via a responsive `<video>` element or `<iframe>` depending on the URL type
- New language strings (`video_url`, `video_url_help`, `hotspot_type_video`) in English and Serbian

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-03
